            "I have an idea for a gaming platform that could be both fun and profitable. The concept is to allow gamers to pay $1 for 100 credits, which they can use to compete for the best score in retro-style games. These competitions could be held daily, weekly, or monthly, with the winner taking the prize pool after a small deduction\u2014say, 5 credits out of each dollar as profit.\n\nTo make it even more interesting, the platform could have two zones: a bot-safe zone and a no-bot zone. This way, we could see what AI and human players come up with, like a 1-day Mario clone run competition. The winner would receive a substantial prize in credits, which could be redeemable, and this is where the platform could generate revenue. Additionally, the data from human speedruns would be invaluable for training and further development.\n\nI think this platform could really capture the competitive spirit and creativity of the gaming and development community. \n\nRevised by chat",

The npcs are independent with a giant wide range of emotions and reactions. Built in. One day theyre happy. And depending on the circumstance. The complex independent ai can fluctuate, blend, and morph moment to moment gameplay. If one of the ai loses their dog, it will have a behaviour to where it will react accordingly. Aka simulate emotions of sadness and tone of voice will be sad. This is insane.",

I doubt they get NPCs with AI right, in particular quests etc. It will be just case based quests, that generate the same way as Radient Quest in Skyrim, so without AI. But AI voices can work, AI environment, AI reacting to the players, AI textures, AI monsters but there's a limit when it becomes quantity over quality and that's what will drag the whole game down. Outside of a sandbox survival game, we hardly need more space. \n\nAs long as assets are not made by AI on the fly, you've seen it all after a certain point. But you can't create everything with AI as some things make no sense and this would hurt the immersion. You'll also have a hard time filling unlimited space with anything meaningful. New game mechanics need testing and you can't have AI make it up, it will be a buggy mess. So I doubt non sandbox games will become any larger. You also want to provide a consistent feeling, so you could create randomly generated cities for GTA, but what if there are glitches, like a missing highway bridge all of a sudden? This would be horrible as player, at the same time you gain so little other than more space to drive. \n\nAI is a tool that will improve game creation mostly. Speed up creation of assets etc. but it will still require supervising and bug checking. At least for now. \n\n I do still dream of a matrix like VR experience, but this is still a bit away.",

That people see a turbocharged Markov chain and think it can understand structured context - let alone creativity or creative writing - and use it for things like the example of generative quest text is so sad to me.

If you create a barebones AI with instructions that are little more than \"defeat the player\" then it will destroy the player by means that even a cheater would struggle to compete against because the AI runs _inside_ the game, they need to impose all kinds of limits on the AI so the AI only takes actions that players can comprehend.

            "The thing is, you really don't want game AI to be TOO smart. In the game designers meta game, you are trying to make a game which is fun to play. A part of that fun comes from being sufficiently challenged. There's a challenge sweet spot. If you make a game that's too easy, it won't be very interesting to players. If you make the game impossible, that won't be too interesting either. But if you make the game somewhere in between, where its sufficiently challenging but not too challenging or too easy, it'll be fun. Game AI which is created to perfection, where \"perfect\" means that it wins every time, puts the game difficulty into the realm of impossible for players. That stops being fun or challenging. So, the real challenge for Game AI programmers is to make the AI good enough to present a bit of a challenge / obstacle and be an adversary against the players goals, while at the same time making it appear convincingly intelligent. It just has to *appear* to be intelligent rather than *actually* being intelligent. At best, your AI agents should be there to challenge the player and keep them honest.",
            "Unless somethings changed in the last 5 years then according to someone I used to work with who had just finished a degree in game design it was difficult to design the AI to be bad enough so that people could actually defeat the enemy/opponent. This has been a problem since the early days of game design. The computer knows what you are doing the moment you do it and can easily beat you due to being able to do everything perfectly in the game, it has to be either seriously dumbed down by imposing limits on them or pre programming reactions, or in shooters a bit of dumbing down and making them weaker is often used.",

There's rarely a changing meta like with RTS and MOBAs and usually aren't fast paced like a FPS or similar.\n\nFor example, in Persona 3 Reload, why doesn't the AI learn the weaknesses of my team like I learn their weaknesses? Some bosses do - and those fights are thrilling and don't feel like you just got RNG'd to death because the AI got lucky with randomly chosen options that happened to work. \n\nThere's a fight later where there's two bosses and they exhibit teamwork just you like can with your team. \n\nEven with RTS, there's often room for improvement. I understand that the developers won't understand necessarily how the gameplay/strategies will get optimized. Once it's in the wild, the players will hash that out, especially in a competitive game. I think patches could be used to develop the AI further as basic strategies like build orders or openings are developed by the player base.\n\nI played a RTS called Kohan: Kings of War and it had a script language where you can build your own AIs. I could build AIs that better emulate the general concepts behind build orders in the early game and keeping the economy going in mid/late game as it builds up forces. \n\nI thought it interesting that all this was built directly into the game along with learning and such to radically alter how the AI played and each AI player to have a different playstyle...yet this wasn't very much explored in the game by the AIs that came with it. \n\nThe game's AI was even written up in a \"How to Make Games\" book back then for it's execution of goal-based AI systems. \n\nSomeone on the dev team obviously cared a LOT about the AI...only for that care to not be used in the shipped product. At least it was available to the players and a sub-community of AI creators emerged as a result, which was cool.",
            "It seems very likely that a big studio or even a small one that is dedicated could train an AI afterwards, once it is developed, and then plug that model back into the game once it has been trained. So in that way the initial AI could be a temporary bootstrap solution. A lot would depend on implementation details, but I think that's probably possible. This doesn't mean super AIs necessarily, but you could even train models at a variety of levels, with a variety of quirks. If the resulting model can be plugged into the game loop in a quick way (and why not?) then that seems like a great way to make some of the game AIs of the future. Heck, there are a lot of old games with virtually no players, or with abandoned multiplayer entirely, or which never had good AI to begin with, which I'd love to play against such models.",

The illusion of smart AI is far more important than them actually being smart, and if the Player has ample tools to predict and outsmart their enemies, that will make for a very good experience.\nI also always like to say that making smart AI is super easy, but making a good AI that is fun to play against is super hard.",

For example, the AI experiences a hardcoded percentage of damage on their building X from enemy type Y units, and a machine-learned solution module would be activated to counter it. Or you could make the AI trigger machine learned, and the response a hardcoded module. This way the machine learning solution becomes far more flexible as things change.",

Imagine an average warehouse scenario with some enemies who are well trained cooperating soldiers. Make a move, breathe too loud, and you're toast before you can react. And you can't easily train an AI to a vague target like \"try to find and eliminate the player, but only so hard, that you only win, if the player makes more than 100 mistakes, and do it slowly\". So convincingly dampening down a well trained AI to a below average player (or even do this for five game difficulty levels ... with the highest still being an intentionally dumb AI) is an interesting challenge by itself.

The reason StarCraft and others are a good learning experience (ha) for ML researchers is because there are certain problems where we really don't know what intermediate states lead to a good outcome, but we do know a good outcome when we see it.  For folding proteins, we don't necessarily know which intermediate states are the correct ones, but we DO know the resultant energy of the final folded state.  For two chess boards, you might not know which one is better, but you definitely know if someone is checkmated.  And for 11:00, one other detail is that machine learning doesn't always give the appropriate control over the behavior of the AI.  You might want the AI to sometimes be less aggressive or less accurate or run away.  With a classical system you get that fine-grained ability to decide what the bots do; not as much with AI.

            "I'd expect it to be more difficult to create a reasonable fallible AI than an optimum AI.  At least with the optimum AI, your ultimate goal is simple to define and test for.  But how do you define an AI that isn't optimum because it fails in realistically human-like ways, while still avoiding unrealistic non-human failures?",
            "I'd call it pathfinding, AI is more applicable to games like chess. It's difficult to test pathfinding, any change to pathfinding behavior influence all other aspect of it. So you can easily get to the point where improving the pathfinding introduces new regressions.",

This massive Achilles' Heel is a fact, and a scary one, as it's the only reason why you aren't jobless right now.\n\nML is always going to be limited to its next step, as it has no intuition, true context sensitivity, or true creativity, and it never will. That's not a \"Go humans!\" statement, it's simply the reason we aren't obsolete. Every task, hobby, field of study, profession, et al becomes exponentially more complicated as time goes on, not easier. You can spend your entire life researching Genetics and never be a master of that field, because for every discovery made, you open the door to an entire new frontier of understanding.

            "There is ONE PIECE of ammo that will be immortal. Context, and the incapability of stupid people. \nImagine this: someone whom you know is terrible at art on whim creates what seems like a masterpiece. You look at their timeline and the amount of time required to make it, is impossible by artist standards or even for their skill level. There is but one conclusion; it\u2019s ai art. \nOr even something like trying to cover it up, obviously ai art will have mistakes of some kind for eons but those mistakes will be harder and harder to catch and easier to cover up\u2026 that is if you\u2019re not an idiot. There\u2019s a certain streisandianness to this, by trying to make the work that wasn\u2019t theirs seem legitimate, they made it more obvious that it wasn\u2019t by doing a terrible job of making it. Terrible writing comes when you plagiarize something and try to rewrite it without knowing how to write well. Conversely terrible art is produced when you don\u2019t know how to make art and try to use AI to produce something that is \u201cgood\u201d without being able to do basic things like join lines properly ,make skies look realistic, or even just try to correct mistakes(Sorry my mother is a professional freelance artist and i know how a lot of this works from her). The part that is impossible to make happen by AI is the personal element to art. Art is from your imagination, perspective, thoughts and experiences. To make ai art and claim it\u2019s the same as human art is to act like people\u2019s art doesn\u2019t hold meaning to culture and society. Which is why it will always be immediately detectable to the trained eye. If you suck at art, you don\u2019t know how to make something that speaks to culture, if you did, you\u2019d have the skills and experience to know how to and to do it yourself.",

            "I think a lot of the problems come from the consumerist mindset. There are legitimately a lot of people out there who roll their eyes when you say art is about communication and about humanity. We\u2019ve lost the idea of art being something we do for its own sake and for the appreciation thereof, and instead a lot of people just think about entertainment. They don\u2019t care if a game or movie has a powerful story, they care if it was entertaining and easy for them to follow along. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s everyone or that it\u2019s unsalvageable, but it is a major problem. If you ask the average person why art exists, I don\u2019t know if they have an answer to that. So many people think of art as just something that is created to waste our time and consume for a bit. And if that\u2019s your mindset, that all that matters is the enjoyment and dopamine release from consuming, then nothing is really lost with ai art.",

The core issue is that it\u2019s stripping away all meaning and increasing isolation, as no longer do we interact with humans as part of experiencing art, we can now just get it mass generated and fed to us as slop from algorithms and there was never any human interaction or communication necessary.",

And yes people can tell the difference between a game and real life, but when it\u2019s specifically meant to be responding to you and imitating humanity for the sake of your immersion in the game?

I think it's neat. aside from greedy asshats like Ubisoft inevitably finding the worst possible ways to use a tool like this, I don't hate it, and I think that some genuinely creative people could use a tool like this to make some interesting games that we've never seen before. but is it \"revolutionary\"? no. it's a neat tool that (assuming this ever makes it into a production-ready toolkit) could achieve a fairly specific result that a few types of game would benefit from immensely and in most others would be at best a curiosity and at worst a distraction. but that's the thing about the \"AI\" hype... when you get past the marketing and look at the actually-useable tools it's produced, it's mostly pretty minor. some workflow optimizations, a few cool niche tools. far from a huge disruption to much of anything. the hype around it has nothing to do with any of the actual merits of the technology. it's entirely driven by a desire to inflate stock prices and discipline labor. the technology, when it actually works at all, is a _distant_ third to those concerns.",

            "The entire point of the progress of technology is that we don't need to waste time on mundane and repetitive tasks but instead have more time to do enjoyable things, like art. The fact that it is used to push people out of making their passion their profession is the worst case scenario in this regard.",
            "AI is an amazing tool, and as long as people who are artistic wants to use it, it will be used for good. Even if it repleacec peoples jobs, that has been true for centuries. New technology always does that, and ai is no different. But the tool has to be used well.",
            "Most coding is not grunt work but involves artistic choices and some parts of graphics production are. There is art in art direction, choosing constraints, and assembling pieces. There is value in just having more variations and being able to pick and finetune generations that fit the vision better. New design spaces open up where combinatorics was a limiting factor, e.g. think throwaway dialogue lines where NPCs should react based on world knowledge. That's not 'low effort' either, there are too many complexities involved, it's a different flavor. The technologies are amazing but nowhere near as amazing or simple as people think. Most AI stuff out in the wild is cheap and soulless, which is a huge danger with AI especially because of the shadowing, but there is a large unexplored space beyond that.",

            "The \"if I don't know whether an artist or an AI made this, is it art?\" thought is the most disturbing to me, because to an extent I understand that arguably experiencing art largely happens between an object and the person looking at it. However, I deeply care about the human act of creating art and learning to create art as a process itself, and I think it matters.",
            "I think there's some game genres that AI NPCs could fit with, like Sandbox games that already use lots of procedural generation. But I think outside of specific/niche genres AI should at best only be used as supplementary. And honestly some of the way I can see AI being usef have already been \"imitated\" in old or Indie games. Like Oblivion NPCs having their own lives or Hades having an entire TOME of dialogue that rivals  LotR and GoT books with a complex dialogue tree. Devs were already reaching the illusion of smart intelligent \"AI-like\" NPCs.",

The idea of whether or not it could be done has again beaten the question of whether or not it should be done.",

            "Every tool that can replace jobs will be used to do so, every time. AI is a special kind of terrible for sure, bringing up new ethical and philosophical questions we hadn\u2019t had to deal with before, but it\u2019s also just another expression of the socioeconomic system we live in. Those who make the most money get to choose how the world\u2019s resources are spent, and how technology develops, and so they will use it in whatever way will make them even more money. Most of the threats posed by AI are threats we have faced, and will continue to face in some way until capitalism inevitably collapses because the workers that keep it running can\u2019t afford to survive. Having to question the legitimacy of art when it can be created without humans is scary, but the most pressing issue is probably the fact that artists will have an even harder time affording to live and affording to make art, and that\u2019s a problem that will always exist until people no longer need to work to live at all",
            "I see myself as a realist. And so I typically take the bluntest route, which will be the same here. First and foremost, I am an artist, it is my job. I have been practicing and trying art on and off for a little over 2 decades. So I fully understand and tend to agree with other artist's opinions on the Ai topic. However, I think it just needs to be said that continuing to object and fight back at this level might do a little good but will mostly just be a waste of time. Ai is going to be pushed hard and it will develop to a point where we legitimately will not be able to tell it's there. And no backlash or comments about morality will stop it. Companies will continue to fire artists as they become (at least in the companies' minds) obsolete. Companies will see revenue growth in almost every area of their workspace and that will be the dominant thing talked about as thousands are laid off from their jobs. And it will likely reach a point where most new generation people will come to accept and promote it and older generations, like we will eventually be, will go to the grave shouting Ai's weaknesses and problems. \n\nI know that for most people this is a nightmare scenario, and I tend to feel the same right now. I always see Ai art, even insanely amazing Ai art, and can feel in my heart that there is no soul in it. No love, no passion, no inspiration put into it, but harsh complacent words rhythmically typed into an old crusty keyboard. I feel that deep in my heart. But to me, continuing to say, \"We can reverse this, we can alter course, we can push past this 'Fad'\"; it just feels like well intended words that are meaningfully dug into the ground, like a barrier against a sharp sword. But it's not a sword that's attacking; it's a bulldozer. \n\n\nI don't really like talking in the comments very often, and when I do it's usually just a joke or quick question or quip.

            "Ain't no way you'll read this among all these comments, but your argument is completely invalid. AI has noting to say about humanity? Funny claim to make after saying it's learned from human-made art. I love AI and I think it will be the thing that truly levels the playing field. It won't take jobs away, it'll just make your job harder (hence the salt).",

But with the more technical side of games like programming, I believe it is much foggier in terms of morals. As an aspiring games programmer, I do think that the technology will most likely shift the roles of that part of Game Dev to be more focused on editing and understanding while the AI will make the code as a type of framework for which the programmers will test and edit the code to ensure understanding and that the mechanic works as intended.",

AI dialogue could be cool for deep RPGs. If a dev created parameters for how a given NPC may react, ie a personality, I think that would be cool. Maybe other forms of AI can create more interesting enemies in some games that aren\u2019t artificially hard from HP or damage buffs but are actually more intelligent and dynamic.

Would I use it as a tool to give players more \"immersion\" content without hurting the development schedule? Sure. Dialogue is a good example. Plot-related dialogue should always be written by a human who understands the finer details of the world and the overall plot. AI as it currently stands has no concept of context or meaning so it can't really do that job to any satisfying degree and even if it could it can't provide any unique perspective. But background NPCs that merely exist as filler and serve no actual purpose but might be fun to be interactable for some players? Sure that's something AI might be useful for.",

First off, that is a very limited niche aspect of what AI as a whole will reshape humanity into. Secondly, something like AI as an option does not illegalize, incapacitate or neuter ANYONE who wishes to create art the traditional way. Please consider the following: Digital Art made certain aspects of Traditional Art antiquated BUT did it STOP ANYONE from buying traditional art supplies and creating art with paint, chalk, ink, etc on canvas, paper, etc.? No. Now look at the prevalence of Digital Art. It has become nearly synonymous with \"Art\", and I am SURE there are traditional artists that roll their eyes at \"Digital Art\" seeing it as a perversion of the \"proper way\". This is now how people are reacting with AI Art. As with anything else, it is a tool. Who says that humans who USE AI Art to SHOW or TELL a story is not creating Art? Tools do not define the Artist. AI is a human invention, a tool just as much as anything else. The only difference now is \"Digital Artist\" have now been put in the position of Traditional artists.\n\nIf you think this will KILL job, then maybe you have lost faith in humanity itself. \"AI will be used to Replace Artists\" . . . really? So, you're saying that AAA companies which are already a dying part of the Game Dev scene, will stop Indie teams from forming? 1, 2, 3, 4, or more person teams that create great games, are they a part of your doomsday scenario? Why are you not tying all of this into the prevalent and growing reality that Game Development has become TOO expensive? Several  MILLION dollars to create an experience that has MAYBE upwards to several days worth of content? And if you follow the recent trends those SEVERAL MILLION dollars game are  not even being received well (go rewatch your video about Starfield for reference of just ONE minor example of MANY). That money could have been spent on SO many other things. It's disgustingly wasteful. I DO see worth and value in AAA dying and all of those artists which would probably have been let go anyway finding a place in tight knit game dev communities to work on actually good products. AAA produces slop, the most economically viable product, and nothing more. It is good that AI will enable smaller teams to create better products.\n\n\"Computers and movies killed the book industry.\" <- Do you see the stupidity of such a statement? Because this is essentially the old guard rhetoric being espoused in this and many other videos regarding AI Tools. AI Tools are here and growing in capability whether we like it or not, Pandora's Box has been opened. As with any change in Technology, Society will adapt accordingly despite it's growing pains (these types of videos).

How often do you feel like you have to roll your eyes when someone shows off something they like, and they can tell you in detail about who made it, how, and how authentic it is?

            "More information about how Albert and Kai were trained:\n\nTime it took to train :\nRoom 1: 12h 30m (though I stopped the recording after Albert broke the game)\nRoom 2: 13h 40m\nRoom 3: 1d 20h 2m\nFinal Battle: 6h 48m (this wasn\u2019t shown but was needed since the agents weren\u2019t used to seeing other teammates)\n\nWe continue training on top of the previous brains, meaning by the end of the video Albert and Kai both have trained for 3 days and 5 hours \n\n\nThank you so much for watching! These short videos take literally hundreds of hours to make, if you want to help allow us to make them faster, please consider becoming a channel member! By becoming a member, your name can be in future videos, you can see behind-the-scenes things that don\u2019t fit in the regular videos, you can also use stickers of Albert, Kai and some other characters our team made in comments  (more coming) :D\n\n\nNOTES\nWhen I mention it took x days to train, that\u2019s in game time, and much larger than the displays indicate since there are 200 copies training simultaneously.\n\nThis is a very long comment going over more of the details of how Albert and Kai works, issues they\u2019ve had, unexpected results etc.\n\n\nTHE BASICS: \nAlbert and Kai were trained using reinforcement learning, meaning they were rewarded for doing things correctly and punished for doing them incorrectly (the reward is just increasing their score, and the punishment is decreasing it). After they finish each attempt, the actions they took are analyzed and the weights in their neural networks (brains) are adjusted using an algorithm called MA-POCA to try to prioritize the actions that led to the most reward. The agents start off making essentially random decisions until Kai accidentally tags Albert in the first room and is rewarded, then, as mentioned above, the weights in his neural network brain are adjusted in order to try to replicate that reward (it wasn\u2019t this simple for this video since we use self-play to train both agents at the same time, more on that later). This leads to Kai learning that tagging Albert is good, and since Albert is punished when he\u2019s tagged, it also leads to Albert learning that getting tagged by Kai isn\u2019t good. This process continues through 10s of millions of steps until one of the agents consistently loses, or the agents are able to counter each other well enough to where it\u2019s a draw.\n\n\nREWARD FUNCTION: \nAlbert and Kai are given two types of rewards, group rewards and individual rewards. When Albert gets tagged he\u2019s punished by getting a -1 group reward and Kai is rewarded by getting a +1 group reward and vice versa, encouraging Kai to tag Albert, and Albert to avoid being tagged by Kai. Additionally, Albert is given an individual reward of 0.001 for each frame he\u2019s alive (0.6 total in a room lasting 10s), and Kai -0.001, to encourage Kai to try to tag Albert as quickly as possible. When we introduce the grabbable cubes we also give Albert an individual reward of +1 the first time he picks up the cube to make sure Albert actually starts using the cube (since without this, the rewards were too infrequent for Albert to learn to use it effectively).\n\n\nBRAIN: \nAlbert and Kai\u2019s brains are neural networks with 4 layers each (one input layer, 2 hidden layers and one output layer).\n\nThe agents collect information about the scene through direct values and raycasts. Every 5 frames they\u2019re fed data about their position in the room, the opponent\u2019s position, velocity, direction etc., and they also collect information through raycasts (a simplified version of eyes). The agent's eyes (raycasts) can differentiate between walls, ground, moveableObjects and Kai/Albert.\n\nThe agents' brains (neural networks) are given the data the agents collect from direct values and raycasts and use them to predict 4 numbers for the respective agent which control how that agent moves. An example of an output of one of the neural networks is: [1, 2, 0, 1], this would be interpreted as [1=move forward, 2=turn right, 0=don\u2019t jump, 1=try to grab], so the agent being controlled by this neural network would try to move forward while turning right and grabbing.\n\nThe fact that we have two agents training simultaneously complicates things a bit, normally we\u2019re able just update the agents brains every x steps, but if we did that for both brains at the same time then they would struggle developing multiple strategies, since reinforcement learning tends to be best at finding a single solution, that would lead to the winner dominating and the loser stuck doing the same strategy over and over. The way we tackle this issue is by using something called self-play. Since we use self-play, we technically only train one agent at a time, and swap which is being trained every 100k steps. When we\u2019re training Albert, we use a recent model of Kai\u2019s brain as his opponent, and to avoid there only being one strategy, we store 10 recent brains to use as opponents, swapping them out every couple thousand steps so that Albert learns to beat all of them and not just one. This results in a much more general AI that\u2019s hard to exploit.\n\n\nUNEXPECTED BEHAVIORS:\nIn room 1 Albert manages to break out of the room by exploiting a small hole in the hitbox near the top of the room, which was there because I didn\u2019t make the hitboxes on the walls tall enough. Though Albert used it to escape, I\u2019m not convinced he actually would learn to do it consistently. The challenge with this video is that it can be difficult to interpret the agent\u2019s behaviors; Albert could be making certain unexpected moves as a way to exploit Kai\u2019s poorly trained brain to get him to make bad moves, or Albert could just be making these unexpected moves because he hasn't trained enough. Albert was able to find the hole a few times, however he wasn\u2019t able to do it consistently, this could be from either him not training long enough, his observations not making it easy to detect when he can jump out, or Kai quickly learning to counter him getting to the display in time.\n\nIn room 2 Albert also manages to glitch out of the room, and he was able to do this consistently. We made sure the cube grabbing functionality was coded as rigorously as possible, even with it automatically detaching the grab if the force exerted is too high, I couldn\u2019t find a single way of exploiting it in testing, but Albert certainly didn\u2019t have issues finding it.\n\nAlbert also had a couple moments of throwing the cubes at Kai and spinning with the cube to throw Kai out of the room, we didn\u2019t even consider this being a possibility before training, AI\u2019s able to come up with some really clever solutions to problems.\n\n\nOTHER\nThank you so much to our amazing team that helped make this video!

If it created doom without ever seeing doom or a game like it, then I would be more impressed. AI will start by making games similar to high quality games that have taken years of tech evolution to get to, but once it no longer gets that source of video reference because no more games are coded, then all AI games will start to feel the same. It's a bit like a copy of a copy of a copy, getting worse each time.

I love making modifications that engines allow.\n \nSecondly, the image in games is already generated at various levels. It may be real-time animation, adding elements at editor-level, compilation-level.\n\nCurrently Artificial Inteligence models can hardly work in real-time to \"predict\" the next frame in a game. This requires a lot of computing-power and is ineffective. \n\nThis is my opinion and experience. I studied AI programming in R language. Additionally it is difficult for me to watch the graphics generated by AI. I still prefer art created by human. Can't help myself.\ud83d\ude42",
            "Imagine if characters in open world games started using artificial intelligence to interact and talk to players naturally. This idea will completely change the gaming experience and make it more realistic and lively. Incorporating artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) technologies into gaming characters will enable them to understand commands and interact with players naturally. The characters will be able to talk to the players, understand their words, and respond to them based on the different context and situations. For example, in a game like GTA 5, characters on the street will be able to interact with you, understand you, and respond to you naturally, and this will make the game more interactive and lively. In Red Dead Redemption 2, characters will be able to interact with you based on your actions and mood, and talk to you normally. Developing character interaction in open-world games using artificial intelligence will be a major step towards providing a more realistic and enjoyable gaming experience, and this will open new doors for creativity in game design and provide unique experiences for players.",

If there were a catastrophic event, we could face a massive technological reset. There's also the concern that AI might start developing its own code, indistinguishable from our own.

If modeled correctly it could be an accurate playground for a school so learning could be easy and fun for future generations and even for us now and even colleges and such could use this to simulate designs and model in vr like design buildings and architecture.

The games that are gonna come out in the next 2-5 years are going to make current games look really limited and lame I feel like.

            "Thanks for checking out not only my 75th episode of AI and Games, but the one dedicated to our 10-year anniversary.  I hope you enjoyed it, and thank you all for your continued support of AI and Games!\n\nAs mentioned in the video, this episode has been on the backlog for a *very* long time.  In fact, long-time viewers may recall from the pinned comment on episode #50 that I had a different idea for celebrating our 50th episode.  I recall looking my research notes at the time, but it wasn't far enough along for me to put it together.  Let me stress I've not been working on this episode every day since 2018.  It's been a little hobby of mine, as I sit and read the odd Lua script, or dig deep into a Reddit thread, trying to piece everything together gradually.  And so when it came to celebrating 10 years of the channel, this was the topic that I just *had* to cover.   \n\nAs mentioned, my Design Dive on Bloodborne will be released in the coming months.  Plus there is a lot of work happening in decompiling Elden Ring nowadays, and I feel compelled to add it to the backlog for a future episode.  Oh and one last thing.  Dark Souls isn't the only episode I've been working away on for years at a time.  I hope to come back with another long overdue deep dive later this year.",

That often leads to weird situation were only one AI can attack at the same time and can feel very scripted to the player.\nDo you know how Dark Soul is tackling that issue? Is that a ticket system? I already tried to records video on few Souls games, on noticed that they allow several AI to attack the player at the same time, but it still feel limited to 3/4 AI at max?\nAlso, I noticed that after attacks AI seems to have cooldown on its attack behavior as it will try to reposition sometimes after attacking while sometimes it will attack directly. I noticed that based on my behavior as a player, they would go more into reposition if I don't attack while if I attack or heal myself they start to become aggressive.\nDo they have a sort of aggressivity system, or is it just part of the \"combat wheel\" you mention, with the recent player input being taking into account to select the next behavior?\n\n2- Behavior Hysteresis: I wonder if there is any mechanics for the AI to keep its current behavior and not always switching to other behaviors? You mentionned with the combat wheel that the probability for specific behavior are constantly being updated. By if that's the case, what prevent the AI for not always switching between a lot of different behaviors? Is the AI locked into a single behavior until the behavior is considered completed?\nTo give an example, if the AI is told: \"When at more than 50 meters, you should go to the player position and do an Attack X\", one common issue is that: If you allow the AI to change its behavior while doing the \"Go To\" action, while the AI is getting closer, you end up with a probability wheel that is going to change completely, meaning that the AI is likely to select something else while as a designer you would have want to keep that behavior for some time. And on the opposite side, if you never allow the behavior to change until completion, you risk the issue that due to some fact, the behavior took time to perform (for example the \"Go To\" didn't go as expected like the player as moved away) and its not relevant at all anymore and the AI should be switching to something else.\nDo you know if there is trick that Dark Soul AI is doing to tackle this issue? :)\n\nAgain thanks a lot for the video, it is very good material!",

I think a majority of FROM players will rank it under Elden Ring, Bloodborne, DS3, and Sekiro. Not only that, the last 1/2 or 1/3 of the game is objectively much worse and even felt to be unfinished when compared to the beginning half. \n\nDS1 is revolutionary for the genre and gaming in general, but unfortunately it falls short when compared to pretty much every other game FROM went on to make (and many of the games inspired by it such as Stellar Blade, Lies of P, Star Wars, etc).",

            "Oh lords I think I just got why sometimes the Godskin Noble in Elden Ring will immediately jump into the rolling animation even if you interrupt it or the start up animation. Usually, getting interrupted must trigger the \"perform rolling attack goal failure\", forcing the Noble to go back and start a new set of goals. This is how most enemies in general work. An enemy may then try to use the same attack it got interrupted preforming, but it'll start the attack pattern from the beginning. In the case of the Noble, playing the wind-up animation again.\n\nBut for whatever reason, every so often, the goal will not fail when interrupted (like with a stance break), and Noble will immediately go into the rolling attack animation almost like a jump-scare, since it doesn't replay the wind up.",

            "Hi,\nPlease forgive what will likely be a longer comment than most. With subtlety & nuance being in rare supply online, I try to be as clear as possible. But my blunt nature is often mistaken for arrogance or condescension. Which is never my intention. As that's pointless when trying to communicate with anyone. \n\nI am but a scrubby indie dev. Who's chosen to focus on systems design. I've been learning UE for 5 years this November. I'm also legally blind (albinism = 20/200 vision). In 2020 I strained my eyes to a point of functional blindness. I could still see. However keeping my eyes open for any length of time caused me physical pain.\n\nSo from June 2020 to June 2021 I was basically blind. All I could do was listen to Caverns & Creature audiobooks & the UE tutorials on loop. Which also gave me a lot of time to think. The technicalities, limitations & realties of game development are wildly misunderstood online. Often leading to name brand gamers innocently spreading misleading information.\n\nI thought it was an issue of language. As in game development using common phrases. But \"Optimization\" means something different in game development. In comparison to the way \"Optimization\" is used in gaming discourse. Online the term is often reduced to \"X game is poorly optimized because it can't hit 60 fps.\"\n\nSo when my vision finally recovered. I set out to listen to gamers and take notes. What do gamers want? What type of systems do they dislike? Things like that. It didn't take long to realize how misunderstood making games is. Or that well meaning YouTubers are often the source of rumors like \"60 fps is standard.\"\n\nFor the record. Yes, 60 fps is great. But out of the 1300+ 9th gen games 39% run at 60. If 60 was indeed a standard, we should see something like 45-51% of games running 60. I've talked to 12 AAA devs on the matter. Every last one agrees 60 is better. Every last one also acknowledged the technicities, limitations & realities that can make it impossible for every game to hit a solid 60.\n\nMy point... I absolutely love your channel. There are plenty of people analyzing games. But your combination of in depth break downs. And practical experience is well priceless. Because if gaming discourse is every to improve. We need more than the often surface level information being presented as facts.\n\nI've found Ai and Games, No Clip & Game From Scratch to be the best sources for solid information on YouTube. And just wanted to take a moment to thank you for this video. As well as the rest of your body of work.\n\nTake care and have a good one",

Any game you could make would just be some knock of of a pre-existing game, with a plotline that you'd have to manually fix from being some jumbled mess.\n\nThen there is the strong presumption that any game you make with AI would not be yours. It would most likely belong to the AI maker, or at the very least it would be restricted to whatever TOS said AI developer places on it.

Assuming every other cost stays the same (marketing packaging distribution etc) thats a significant increase to their profit margin. So much so that they could actually lose a fair amount of customers due to a decrease in quality while still remaining profitable.\n\nAnd from a business standpoint if you can overtime decrease costs enough to have enough money to develop 2 games instead of 1 you're able to diversify your revenue streams.\n\nAI has enough potential upsides that companies cant afford to be the one business in their industry not using it. Its going to happen\n\nThe question is will it be good or entertaining or just more consumer slop",
            "AI in gaming (or any creative industry for that matter) is an absolutely TERRIBLE idea, and I hope it never catches on. AI cannot be creative or create new things, it can only analyze data and create an amalgamation of what it sees based on what you tell it. Anything that AI makes is generic and bland because it's incapable of thinking and making decisions. What makes art unique and what gives it soul, IS the decision making and process of creating it, and the experience and vision of the artist creating it, AI cannot do that because it has no experience or vision and makes no decisions, it is merely about achieving the end product as efficiently as possible, and there's nothing artistic about that. This applies to any form of art, drawing, music, movies, writing and acting, everything AI will produce will be nothing but generic, boring identity-less slop\r\n\nI also disagree on the point of art getting democratized. Today art is more accessible than it ever was, everything you could possibly need to start making whatever you want is easily accessible for either really cheap or even free. The difference is that you have to put in effort and grow as an artist, and most people don't want to do that, which is why AI sounds so appealing to them. But the reason art is impressive is BECAUSE of that learning process. Would you be more impressed if an AI generated the most detailed, beautiful picture of a flower you've ever seen, or if a human artist painted it by hand...\r\n\nThe artistic side of all that aside, AI generated gameplay also sounds terrible. I would rather go through a static level, which is intentionally designed to challenge certain skills in a fun and clever way, by someone who fundamentally understands what makes a video game fun and engaging, than spend hours in some open, bland and generic world, with nothing-burger quests that are not interesting whatsoever and are only there as filler to waste my time. AI will never be able to design a good game because it has no concept of \"fun\", you could try explaining to it what that is by giving it examples of what humans like, but it will never be able to UNDERSTAND it. Game development isn't just some list of bullet points that you can go through, it requires active decision making and consideration, which AI can't do.\nAlso the gaming market is already extremely oversaturated, what do you think will happen is EVEN MORE people start making games?\n\nIn short, there is no art without an artist. and AI doesn't belong anywhere near entertainment.\n\n\r\n\r\nSorry for the long comment but as you can tell I feel pretty strongly about AI in art and entertainment.",
            "AI just fasten game development",
            "I am sure content that's made by ai on the fly will be so consistently ass that it'll be unusable, but using ai to say, generate 2000 side quests for a Bethesda game, then hire an actual human to read through the slop ai made, fix what's broken, and you probably have like 200 quests that are actually good. Same for set pieces, random encounter tables. Don't put ai output directly into the game, just use it to generate more stuff faster",
            "As always, AI is a tool. Whether its good or bad depends on how its being used. If you grab a hammer and treat everything like a nail, you're inevitably going to break something. But that's a problem with the wielder, not the tool.\n\nAI definitely has places where it could be used to improve games. And plenty of places where its use will make them worse. This is why I don't worry about AI being used in video games. I worry about what companies are going to be using AI in their games. Because I don't trust Meta, or EA, or Activision, or any \"AAA\" level company to use AI in a way that actually benefits either their players, or their employees. I expect them to use it to do nothing but pad their pockets to the detriment of all else, because that's all they do with any tool they get their hands on.\n\nSo, while its just the \"AAA\" level companies that can afford AI for their games, it will suck. And it won't be until its cheap and easy enough for indie devs to use it as well that we'll actually start to see any kind of worthwhile benefits from it. Just like every other new tool that has entered the gaming industry.",

Game balance between creating a challenge and being unfair is a delicate thing for developers already, let alone AI.

The latest models when doing simple text adventures are actually really good and they can come up with scenarios, events and build the world pretty well. But, the god damn context window makes it forget everything so god damn fast. If we could have an AI at the current level of GPT4o or Claude3.5 with a context window that is longer then a human lifespan of memories, then the possibilites would be endless. If it is able to recall literelly everything of the world thus far on every single prompt it would be near perfect. Right now I'm using a special AI for Claude3.5 with various stats it has to display on every turn. It helps a lot and holds memories of characters and many other things for longer periods of times, it also is dynamic and changes health, hunger etc, even the time of day and follows as calendar, and list upcoming events that it will know when they occur. Even keep summorrized memories of yesterday, a week, month back etc. Its wonderful how well it works right now with Claude3.5. Having stats like this is valuable even for an AI that would have almost limitless memories, just to tell it what to keep track of. But with so much memory you could keep adding more and more things for it, like a wikipedia that it would build in the background of the emerging world you're playing. For a new character, it would prompt the appearance, background, biography and personality, but also future goals, what it thinks of the player, what it wants to do in the future and in the moment before the next turn. The AI should even prompt for future events, plan the possible future scenarios and change such things that is not yet known for the player dynamically. So that every turn is not just emergence of things at the present, but is highly planned but morphing depending on player action. The AI will know what the player is aware of, making those things stable, while all the planning and wider world building the player does not yet know be ever changing and adapting. You discovered a new village, the ai will generate much background information of that village, locations, people, secrets, history etc etc, and how that village is related to many other things in the world.

But I guess first we need to buy the \"Assasins Creed Maker\" and a bunch of asset packs/dlcs. Now this example would actually be more than an interesting hypothesis, it could revolutionary gaming;\nSay you buy a base game, let's say Skyrim. You start to play it because you liked Oblivion. You tell the damn game \"I don't like this at all, I would rather have Oblivion with this engine\".

            "To celebrate 10 years of AI and Games, there was one topic that warranted being revisited one last time, the AI of FEAR. But this time I wanted to do something special. Over the past 3 months I've sat down and had several (online) interviews with Dr Jeff Orkin: the AI programmer on FEAR.\n\nIn this retrospective, we get into the backstory of how the AI of FEAR came to be. The academic influences, the crazy risks being taken, the lack of oversight, a pivot from 60s espionage to sci-fi horror, the creativity of the development team behind it, and the legacy the game has had in the game AI community.\n\nA huge thank you to Jeff for participating in these interviews. I've had a great time listening to his stories. Critically for me, FEAR was massively influential in my own career path and without it, my trajectory through grad school would have been drastically different. And of course, given it was the inaugural episode of AI and Games, the YouTube channel may never have been created.",
            "Could see yourself climbing a ladder or running around.... or flying scissor kicking people people in the head in slow mo. How was there never another game like this one. Pure joy.",
            "This just makes me wish that NOLF 3 was a thing",
            "Amazing video. You guys inspire me a lot!",
            "\u201cOkay, whatever, it better work\u201d said every boss ever\u2026",
            "I mean you basically listed all the videos i could want from this channel in the first segment: Stalker, Republic Commando, etc",
            "My man rocking the 2-Xl on the right shelf. Awesome.",
            "Replaying this game right now and it holds up so well\u2026 the bits that haven\u2019t aged are the cheesy horror and the story but gameplay-wise it is just 100% all the way. Nothing else like it",
            "I\u2019ll just boost engagement, I don\u2019t have anything to say really that hasn\u2019t been said",
            "Something I learned from this video is that today\u2019s gaming is missing risk takers. The fact they was using all their resources just to make the AI challenging is truly amazing awhile everyone doubted monolith decisions they excelled by making a timeless masterpiece",
            "Damn it. We would have had Nolf 3. My favourite Monolith series. This sucks. I don't know why companies look at other companies and decide this won't work even though lot of times a good unique game succeeds. Nolf 2 actually have really good AI. There is an article from Monolith where GOAP is explained with Nolf 2 as base. It is quite clear that Nolf 2 is the start of Fear AI.",
            "Can we get games with good AI again?! F.E.A.R. should have become the benchmark for AI but games seem like they've gotten worse in the last 10 years.",
            "this is one of the best videos on FEAR I have ever seen, if not the best.",
            "FEAR was one game I had to upgrade my GPU too a 6800 GT. Brilliant game. Absolutely fantastic.  Up there with Half Life, Halo and Unreal.",
            "this video made me sub.",
            "F.E.A.R.'s AI is still unrivaled in the artform. The Replicas and Armacham forces are so much fun to fight against because the AI was designed to be as smart as possible, thus turning who would normally be generic mooks into dangerous threats whom you have to outsmart.\n\nAnd one of the reasons why I'm in the camp that also loves F.E.A.R. 2 is that the GOAP AI made a triumphant return, and is still fun to fight against in that game.",
            "The fact that Monolith dipped their toes in fps games as varied in tone as FEAR and NOLF....is amazing.\nSuch wild swings are practically unheard of in today's times.\nCompanies today are shit scared to dip their toes into anything remotely \"wild\" and experimental....least they rock the stockholders boat.\nAAA gaming today is utterly bland and soul less.....and it doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon.\nAt least we can go back to these wild games that scratch that itch.",
            "I would be very interested in your thoughts about the fact that most of the games we recognize as having impactful AI were released so long ago? AI breathes life into games, but these days people seem more interested in using AI to generate silly pictures\u2026 Will it come back around?",
            "Two great men \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udef6",
            "Jeff Orkin is a LEGEND! I'm happy to learn about him and his experience on creating F.E.A.R. This game will be forever a masterpiece in history.",
            "Sorry to go a bit off-topic but Alien vs Predator 2 was such a good game. \nI dunno but it feels like it didn\u2019t deserve the acclaim it should halve. \nBoth the amazing single player story and the asymmetrical multi player where great games. \nGot some great memories of the latter with death matches.",
            "M a s t e r p i e c e\n\nLove F.E.A.R., love the video",
            "Awesome video, man! This has to be one of the greatest retrospectives I've seen on FEAR!\n\nNow, I would like to give you some feedback regarding the Brazilian Portuguese translation of the video's subtitles and description. I don't know if you got someone to do it or if you used AI/Machine Translation, but the amount of mistakes and overall lack of care are really concerning. I'm not sure about the quality of the other translations, but the PT-BR one is just not acceptable. In regards to the subtitles, they are too literal and badly formatted for a good reading experience.",
            "As a single-player experience, I'd say FEAR is just about the FPS made since... 2005?\n\nIt always makes me sad to listen to people like Jeff Orkin speak about game dev in the 1990s and early 2000s. These guys were always trying to experiment and make cool stuff. Of course they had to worry about sales, but it wasn't like today where every single facet of most games gets degraded in order that the dev can monetize the \"enhancements\" and \"fixes\". It just doesn't feel like devs have a passion for what they make, nor any concern for the consumer's experience.",
            "Great video - thank you!",
            "2025 The game begins with a call to the senator. A female voice reports problems with the Source: \u201cRiot. Fettel has taken over control of the prototypes.\" Armacham Technology was a weapons developer with a military program: an army of clone troopers subordinate to a commander who controlled them using telepathy. Paxton Fettel uses his telepathic abilities to take control of a battalion of clone troopers. Fortunately, to stop an armed conflict, it is enough to eliminate the commander, after which the clones will cease to act and will be absolutely safe. And finding Fettel won\u2019t be difficult: he has a sensor implanted in his head that gives away his location. He will not have any protection, one of the conditions of the program is the safety of the commander, he does not fight along with the rest of the soldiers, but only controls them at a considerable distance. The protagonist of the game is a new operative officer \u201cF. E.A.R.\u201d",
            "Hell yeah",
            "Fear remastered and use the money earned to reboot series^^^",
            "The video is great, awesome insight and i love how he makes it seems simpler than it really is.\n\nJust one observation the sound in the background while Jeff is talking makes quite hard to concentrate on the subject... had to re-watch the video because the background noise is too distracting",
            "It's a shame that no one makes games with such high-quality AI anymore. Well Fear, no one has made a game like this to this day.",
            "Its cool for someone like me to hear about all the work that went into this game when all I can remember is how scared I got almost 20 years ago when you go down that ladder and you see that girl where you just were",
            "F.E.A.R. is just hands down one of the best shooters of all time. Genuinely the best squad AI in a game ever. UT2004's bots come a close 2nd place but for tactical combat the Replicas win.\nHearing Orkin's story was amazing, what a super talented genuine guy!\nGreat and well edited video!",
            "My computer couldn't play fear when it came out. \n\nStill haven't but I really need to.",
            "Well, thanks to Jeff for making an AI that is fun to setup in combat arenas with the SDK, altho having to manually create the navmesh is something x)\nAlso amazing video!!",
            "Unless they patched it, i remember that the loading of the soldiers in an area would slow down the game a bit and all you had to do to clear an area was walk through a door to trigger the enemies and then they would all funnel through the door in a line.",
            "I never played F.E.A.R. before, i know i watched videos the AI is very smart, so thanks to this video i bought the game and holy crap, community weren't liying with the AI of this game, a freaking enemy run around a building just to take me by surprise and attack me.",
            "Dude, i am surprised you still didn't make any video on rain world",
            "Not getting any feedback from anyone ever is a very familiar thing I have experienced myself, working in the industry.",
            "46:45 In my view as someone who is currently attempting to build a interesting AI system for a tactical shooter type game I think what's 'haunting the industry' here is how much knowledge is necessary to have rolled up in those few people with real influence of how to allocate the time and budget to see this thru. To know how to craft gameplay like the beloved parts of F.E.A.R you need a high level understanding of how to design the technical state machines, behavior trees, path-finding that is mirrored by the spatial design of the level by someone who is also a proficient gamer who understands how to hold angles and what affordances different cover and placement will provide. The difficulty is in how to create a scenario that forces the player to traverse the environment mindful of exposure and have the AI functionally play 'cat and mouse' attempting to get the drop on one another. \n\nGames of this era was still made by teams of all enthusiasts who built games they themselves would want to play.  A small team that can pivot on a dime where everyone understands a lot about the thing they're attempting to build at an enthusiast level are a lot better poised to get it right than a gargantuan team where you have to clear every decision with people who may or may not have the slightest clue what you're talking about or even able to play your own game well.\n\nF.E.A.R itself  is very start/stop with those ingenious 'combat space arenas' we all remember being dotted thruout a game intermingled with long segments of the same sort of linear corridor geometry guilty of all the same mistakes how forgettable encounters in titles before/after tend to play out.\n\nReplayability needs unpredictability and that is something even F.E.A.R only succeeds with in a handful of places where the start configuration of the encounter doesn't determine how the rest unfolds. That slice of F.E.A.R that get all of this so right is what needs to be lifted out and studied in great detail, it's a synergy where ones understanding of player tactics, AI tactics and spatial level design all play equal importance.",
            "Fascinating video! I've always wanted to get into game dev, and similar to Jeff, I was interested in animation and graphics part but AI and behaviour programming sounds so much more interesting to me.",
            "My favourite chatter from the enemies was \n\"Where should I go?\"\n\"Shut the fuck up!\"\n\nIt really got across the stress of the situation. \n\n\"Where is he? Fuck! Oh shit! He's wiped out the whole squad!\"",
            "Always love hearing about f.e.a.r",
            "Wow Jeff is awesome. This is a great insight into those early days and how much more exciting and productive the whole industry was.",
            "Any people wanted to relive F.E.A.R. without replaying it should check out Trepang2",
            "I think this is the best way to celebrate the 10 years, and I love all the context that Dr Orkin gives us. He really walks you through how GOAP came to be, and I loved that. Amazing, simply amazing video as always!",
            "Commenting for the algorithm primarily, but also to just give my two cents on the final big question.\n\nI think a big part of what makes the A.I. in F.E.A.R. still hold up so well is the way in which it was so closely integrated with the level and audio design, animation work, and the gameplay in general. The enemies feel interactive, reactive, and exciting because so much of what they do relates to their surroundings, as well as to the presence and their knowledge about the player character. The use of calls and responses in their dialogue, and actions like firing while retreating, diving through windows, and hiding make them seem especially dynamic, even if most of those are ultimately achieved through relatively simple audio cues and pre-built map pieces being triggered by the A.I. Also, it may seem like a strictly stylistic gameplay choice, but the ability to slow down the action and see combat unfold more clearly also helps to highlight the quality of the incorporation of the A.I. further.\n\nAll in all, while I do think it's fair to argue that more recent games using GOAP or other systems have more advanced A.I., it's the close integration of the enemy A.I. with F.E.A.R.'s various systems that make it so impressive. And with how segmented and often disparate various parts of game development typically are in the modern industry due to larger teams and longer development times, achieving such a tight connection between A.I., gameplay design, level design, and presentation simply isn't going to happen as easily. F.E.A.R. came at just the right time.",
            "51:26 Hey you! You're finally awake. I have no idea why I laughed so much.",
            "This was a great interview! It is sad seeing a lot of AI in games being just kinda of bland and good enough. Disappointing to hear he's doing genAI now. Hopefully it's using ethical training data.",
            "Great video. I've always has great respect for Jeff Orkin and have tried to implement his GOAP stuff multiple times (out of interest mostly, I'm not a game dev, just love the stuff) so it's really great to see him and hear him talk about this. Loved it.",
            "This game really shines when you make a no-slowmo playthrough, and the higher the difficulty the better. That's how you really get to appreciate the smart AI, instead of plowing through them like Neo, leaving them no time to do much of anything.",
            "Amazing work once again! \u2764",
            "Man, I don't have a PC to replay FEAR, Xbox needs to get this back on the marketplace.",
            "Straight jorkin it",
            "Small correction. Trespasser (1998) was the first FPS that let you see your character model. Notably health was a heart tattoo on their mammary gland.",
            "A.I. drives engagement in games, While graphics have been steadily improving A.I. seems to change in leaps. Some studios just find out what is already out there and is the bare minimum to get the game \"working\". I hope the future holds some great experiences.\nAs a hobby game programmer when I was younger without knowing what it even was I made a rudimentary Finite State machine to control my CPU enemy.",
            "20:45 funnily enough in my goap implementation i called it GOAT (goal oriented action thinker i explain it) \ud83d\udc10",
            "What will happen before 2025 on F.E.A.R.?",
            "The idea that the enemies always talk to each other rather themselves is the genius of FEAR (saying \u201cwhere is he?\u201d \u201cBehind the box\u201d rather than \u201cI can\u2019t see him\u201d)",
            "Tommy got that original 2XL in the background!",

            "Great video but I had to skip the chapter \u201cOrkin\u2019s path into games\u2019 due to the irritating background noise throughout.  EDIT:  Seems like it persists in some form for the entire video.  What a shame.",
            "I will never understand why they haven't made a Remaster/Remake of the first FEAR game. I am pretty sure they could sell a lot of copies.",
            "Thank you soooo much for this, just found out your channel, FEAR was/is an amazing game for me, hearing the mind behind the AI it's so cool! : )",
            "i wish AA quality games like FEAR were still made today. Sometimes a hyper polished, focused, masterfully made yet smaller-in-scope game is all I want.",
            "Bring on F.E.A.R 4 pls",
            "I remember a lot of FEAR being held up as a high watermark for AI in video games, still is to this day like in this video, and it was one.\n\nBut I remember a somewhat hilarious moment playing it when I would kill an enemy, close a door, another enemy would open the door, I'd kill them, and I quickly had a mound of enemies piled up right at the door that the other soldiers kept running into and and instead of reacting in any sensible way they just kept coming though and dying lol. A moment of artificial dumbness.\n\nAlso made me paranoid of climbing game ladders from the jump scares\n\nI'd still love to see a new modern FEAR game.",
            "I'll be back if you reup without that obnoxious audio background noise.\n\nWtf were you thinking?",
            "Fear should definitely get a remaster to fix the bugs and improve the visual fidelity but the gameplay and story is already perfect! I'm so glad this channel exists and I hope you come out with more banger content as AI becomes more advanced.",
            "graphics are getting and better every year, but not the gameplay... almost everything is so mainstream now",
            "amazing, congrats",
            "That was a really great watch, thanks \ud83d\ude42. FEAR is definitely still awesome today. It would be very cool if you could track down Tom Leonard, formerly of Looking Glass Studios... I'm still awestruck about his work on Thief: The Dark Project \ud83d\ude42",

            "What an excellent revisit/retro celebration, hard to believe it's 20 years ago already! Started with Shogo and although early 2000s Monolith may be a niche it definitely was mine - would be wonderful seeing NOLF3 someday with all the advancements and new discoveries Jeff make on dialogue/etc, including what comes out of the recent language model chatGPT hype. I read his paper back in uni days, the time he spent in the office back then have definitely paid off. FEAR is the mind thriller!",
            "f.e.a.r. the fist attempt for an advanced npc ai and also the last..",
            "excellent video and interview. you mention around 21:15 that quake 3 was the first to solve or popularize or standardize navigation meshes but I am curious to hear about original unreal's method of solving this problem or if they also used navigation mesh at that time. unreal's bot support was the king for quite a while and even compared to quake 3 has its own qualities. it's possible these bot paths were all hand crafted but I feel like I remember playing custom maps with them. I know nothing and any information regarding the topic would be very cool to learn about",
            "Maybe the large size of teams is why games release so broken these days. Too many cooks in the kitchen.",
            "Oh fuck yes! Redo of F.E.A.R.",
            "On your question as to why FEAR doesn't seem to have been surpassed 20 years later i think it's a two sided issue. When you look at the top games you often reference too it's FEAR ( G.O.A.P ), Half-life ( finite state machines ), Halo ( behavior trees ). But one thing all these games have incommon are aggressive enemies with varied behaviors and they communicate ( bark ) a lot. I think this is also what Jeff also points out where his close working relationship with animators, level designers and audio recording all involved him to some degree. The AI is extremely good but the player wont know if it's not communicated to them by the AI putting the spotlight on itself ( sort of that stage for the NPC quote he mentioned ). I think it's understimated how much impact this has. \nThen the other side of the issue is like he points out how risk adverse game development has become. Combine that with a large part of the industry now being formally educated in the use of ready made tools like  unreal, unity etc  instead of talented programmers with a propensity for games . And it seems the chances for something interesting to happen are slim to none. I'd fully expect there to be more impressive systems out there by now and maybe there are but they aren't communicated well. It seems there isn't much interest in making smarter AI oponents in the space where budgets would allow such investments  and i suspect if anything will happen it's going to come from the indie space.",

The tech in it is not new and they do not claim that it is new.  It is a very refined and mass producible version of a BCI.  So it is reading the signals that are coming out of the brain and turning them into action. For example if you think about the word bread nothing will happen if you think about saying the word bread it can read the signal thats going to your vocal cords and translate that into the word bread.  With the demo six months ago that person first had to create the intention of moving something up like he was attempting to move his hand to move the curser up.  Just like we how we at first learn to move a mouse forward to move a curser.  And just like how we learn to move a mouse he trained this ability to control and the program learned with him to the point where he could move curser in a similar way we move the curser, in fact it required less messaging because it was programed specifically for him and didn't require the intermediary of his hand.  But it was still just reading the signal coming from the brain the same way our hands read the signal from our brain and where the mouse is our digital interface the Neurolink was the digital interface.  Regardless there is no technology that is even close to understanding conscious thought in the sense of mindreading or creating dream like space.  Also note by saying this I am not belittling Neurolink or BCIs in general the technology is amazing especially for those who are physically disabled.",

For example, I see a lot of people take a whole bucket of balls and smack them, one by one, off of a little patch of astroturf.  I refer to this as swearing practice.  It goes like this:  smack a ball and say, \"awwwww!\"  Smack another and say, \"damn it.\"  Smack another and say, \"sh1t!\"  I'm not sure how this event is scored, but I've picked up a few things just from watching it.  1)  You can reuse a swear as many times as you like, but don't use the same swear twice in a row.  2)  A disgusted facial expression is important - but create a balance here:  If you are using more words (no!, WTF?), then less facial expression is required, but if you're using more sounds (sheesh, ugh, ohhhhh) then more facial expressiveness is called for.    3)  The lower and shorter the path of travel of the ball, the louder the swear should be.  4)  I can tell that this is actually much harder than it looks because very young golfers don't do it as much.  It's mostly guys in their 40s and 50s that are doing it, so obviously it takes decades to develop proficiency.",

            "The addiction to TV has been existent for much longer and that has become only slightly more common with the convenience of subscription services. I agree that the social interaction makes teens more attached, but that's because those teens may lack other forms of social interaction, not necessarily addiction from the start. It's the same with social media. And it's not all bad either, but there are many risks with minors being online in general.\n\nBut, I don't think the video games, social media or the Internet are as problematic. The core problem has always been a lack of cultural immersion and education stemming from families. Also, some people have a more addictive nature compared to others, so its difficult to assess with generalizations.\n\nAlso, there will always be kids that dream about other things instead of their school work, but many times different forms of media influence even their career plans, so I think that point is completely off and is almost unrelated"

At the end of the day War Robots can do what they want, WR community can do and support who they want, but I'm finally here to adress some of the lies they made up and all the cyberbullying that I experienced. Because let's make it clear, there are a lot of people who tell lies about me and a lot of them who believes it. Hope this brings clarity to some, but thank you to everyone who believed me from the start! Thank you to everyone who supported me through it all, the good and bad, I really appreciate you all! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe live stream where they stream sniped me, the game was at 53.21: https://www.youtube.com/live/IP9fHBDsjqU?si=0aHuqDrKvxBhfmXM\n\nThe video I made after the stream sniping live stream, in there I showed everyone is from EU server: https://youtu.be/GRLvIvR6LAw?si=LOX0glUMhov9Hhmz\n\nWhat is Cyberbullying, UNICEF: https://www.unicef.org/end-violence/how-to-stop-cyberbullying",

I teammates ( personally) but yeh, there are a lot of cry babies in it.\nAdrian banned me a week ago on live chat because one of his Snow Flake bed wetters didn't like the way I mentioned \"Imugi\" 3 times in about a 3 minute period. No warning, Adrian just banned me after the bed wetter told Adrian to make me stop, booo hoooo hoooo. Adrian banned me, no warning, nothing so I no longer respect Adrian or his Diaper Clan anymore, life is to short for that nonsense Majchy. Enjoy watching your games but remember it's just a game. You will always come across mean people where ever you go Majchy. \nI just dont waste time \"anymore\" with people like that.
