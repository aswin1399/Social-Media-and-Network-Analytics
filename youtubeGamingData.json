Also I have a dream of ultimate game mixing all three types ai, story one, generative and ai powered. Imagine that you enter something like skyrim, you get a new map of it, you can find unique artefacts that nobody will find and meet characters which can possibly exist only in your playthrough! I hope that I'll have a chance to play such game.",

I doubt they get NPCs with AI right, in particular quests etc. It will be just case based quests, that generate the same way as Radient Quest in Skyrim, so without AI. But AI voices can work, AI environment, AI reacting to the players, AI textures, AI monsters but there's a limit when it becomes quantity over quality and that's what will drag the whole game down. Outside of a sandbox survival game, we hardly need more space. \n\nAs long as assets are not made by AI on the fly, you've seen it all after a certain point. But you can't create everything with AI as some things make no sense and this would hurt the immersion. You'll also have a hard time filling unlimited space with anything meaningful. New game mechanics need testing and you can't have AI make it up, it will be a buggy mess. So I doubt non sandbox games will become any larger. You also want to provide a consistent feeling, so you could create randomly generated cities for GTA, but what if there are glitches, like a missing highway bridge all of a sudden? This would be horrible as player, at the same time you gain so little other than more space to drive. \n\nAI is a tool that will improve game creation mostly. Speed up creation of assets etc. but it will still require supervising and bug checking. At least for now. \n\n I do still dream of a matrix like VR experience, but this is still a bit away.",

The concept is to allow gamers to pay $1 for 100 credits, which they can use to compete for the best score in retro-style games. These competitions could be held daily, weekly, or monthly, with the winner taking the prize pool after a small deduction\u2014say, 5 credits out of each dollar as profit.\n\nTo make it even more interesting, the platform could have two zones: a bot-safe zone and a no-bot zone. This way, we could see what AI and human players come up with, like a 1-day Mario clone run competition. The winner would receive a substantial prize in credits, which could be redeemable, and this is where the platform could generate revenue. Additionally, the data from human speedruns would be invaluable for training and further development.\n\nI think this platform could really capture the competitive spirit and creativity of the gaming and development community. \n\nRevised by chat",

If you make the game impossible, that won't be too interesting either. But if you make the game somewhere in between, where its sufficiently challenging but not too challenging or too easy, it'll be fun. Game AI which is created to perfection, where \"perfect\" means that it wins every time, puts the game difficulty into the realm of impossible for players. That stops being fun or challenging. So, the real challenge for Game AI programmers is to make the AI good enough to present a bit of a challenge / obstacle and be an adversary against the players goals, while at the same time making it appear convincingly intelligent. It just has to *appear* to be intelligent rather than *actually* being intelligent. At best, your AI agents should be there to challenge the player and keep them honest.",

There's rarely a changing meta like with RTS and MOBAs and usually aren't fast paced like a FPS or similar.\n\nFor example, in Persona 3 Reload, why doesn't the AI learn the weaknesses of my team like I learn their weaknesses? Some bosses do - and those fights are thrilling and don't feel like you just got RNG'd to death because the AI got lucky with randomly chosen options that happened to work. \n\nThere's a fight later where there's two bosses and they exhibit teamwork just you like can with your team. \n\nEven with RTS, there's often room for improvement. I understand that the developers won't understand necessarily how the gameplay/strategies will get optimized. Once it's in the wild, the players will hash that out, especially in a competitive game. I think patches could be used to develop the AI further as basic strategies like build orders or openings are developed by the player base.\n\nI played a RTS called Kohan: Kings of War and it had a script language where you can build your own AIs. I could build AIs that better emulate the general concepts behind build orders in the early game and keeping the economy going in mid/late game as it builds up forces. \n\nI thought it interesting that all this was built directly into the game along with learning and such to radically alter how the AI played and each AI player to have a different playstyle...yet this wasn't very much explored in the game by the AIs that came with it. \n\nThe game's AI was even written up in a \"How to Make Games\" book back then for it's execution of goal-based AI systems. \n\nSomeone on the dev team obviously cared a LOT about the AI...only for that care to not be used in the shipped product.

This doesn't mean super AIs necessarily, but you could even train models at a variety of levels, with a variety of quirks. If the resulting model can be plugged into the game loop in a quick way (and why not?) then that seems like a great way to make some of the game AIs of the future.

Because of how machines and programs process information and translate it into meaningful action, optimizing AI would mean it would take all the information that a normal human wouldn't have access to or the means to process and execute it at close to peak efficiency, which made games feel as though they were cheating. After all, all an AI needs to do is basically respond in kind to a player input at light speed and there you go. It's basically the same reason why all the \"catch up\" mechanics in racing and sports games are done \"off screen\". The most egergious example of optimized AI is in the arcade, where CPUs were designed to operate at peak performance to eat up quarters and tokens like no one's business.\n\nAs someone who actually--as in, actually--works in this area, AI that is too optimized equates for less a satisfactory game experience than one would think, whereas a dumb AI just frustrates. It's why mechanics generally work according to the \"built course\" than the \"built response\" in terms of input-output. You can actually see the hurdles in the former.",

There is but one conclusion; it\u2019s ai art. \nOr even something like trying to cover it up, obviously ai art will have mistakes of some kind for eons but those mistakes will be harder and harder to catch and easier to cover up\u2026 that is if you\u2019re not an idiot. There\u2019s a certain streisandianness to this, by trying to make the work that wasn\u2019t theirs seem legitimate, they made it more obvious that it wasn\u2019t by doing a terrible job of making it. Terrible writing comes when you plagiarize something and try to rewrite it without knowing how to write well. Conversely terrible art is produced when you don\u2019t know how to make art and try to use AI to produce something that is \u201cgood\u201d without being able to do basic things like join lines properly ,make skies look realistic, or even just try to correct mistakes(Sorry my mother is a professional freelance artist and i know how a lot of this works from her). The part that is impossible to make happen by AI is the personal element to art. Art is from your imagination, perspective, thoughts and experiences. To make ai art and claim it\u2019s the same as human art is to act like people\u2019s art doesn\u2019t hold meaning to culture and society.

However, I think it just needs to be said that continuing to object and fight back at this level might do a little good but will mostly just be a waste of time. Ai is going to be pushed hard and it will develop to a point where we legitimately will not be able to tell it's there. And no backlash or comments about morality will stop it. Companies will continue to fire artists as they become (at least in the companies' minds) obsolete. Companies will see revenue growth in almost every area of their workspace and that will be the dominant thing talked about as thousands are laid off from their jobs. And it will likely reach a point where most new generation people will come to accept and promote it and older generations, like we will eventually be, will go to the grave shouting Ai's weaknesses and problems. \n\nI know that for most people this is a nightmare scenario, and I tend to feel the same right now. I always see Ai art, even insanely amazing Ai art, and can feel in my heart that there is no soul in it. No love, no passion, no inspiration put into it, but harsh complacent words rhythmically typed into an old crusty keyboard. I feel that deep in my heart. But to me, continuing to say, \"We can reverse this, we can alter course, we can push past this 'Fad'\"; it just feels like well intended words that are meaningfully dug into the ground, like a barrier against a sharp sword. But it's not a sword that's attacking; it's a bulldozer. \n\n\nI don't really like talking in the comments very often, and when I do it's usually just a joke or quick question or quip.

First off, that is a very limited niche aspect of what AI as a whole will reshape humanity into. Secondly, something like AI as an option does not illegalize, incapacitate or neuter ANYONE who wishes to create art the traditional way. Please consider the following: Digital Art made certain aspects of Traditional Art antiquated BUT did it STOP ANYONE from buying traditional art supplies and creating art with paint, chalk, ink, etc on canvas, paper, etc.? No. Now look at the prevalence of Digital Art. It has become nearly synonymous with \"Art\", and I am SURE there are traditional artists that roll their eyes at \"Digital Art\" seeing it as a perversion of the \"proper way\". This is now how people are reacting with AI Art. As with anything else, it is a tool. Who says that humans who USE AI Art to SHOW or TELL a story is not creating Art? Tools do not define the Artist. AI is a human invention, a tool just as much as anything else. The only difference now is \"Digital Artist\" have now been put in the position of Traditional artists.\n\nIf you think this will KILL job, then maybe you have lost faith in humanity itself. \"AI will be used to Replace Artists\" . . . really? So, you're saying that AAA companies which are already a dying part of the Game Dev scene, will stop Indie teams from forming? 1, 2, 3, 4, or more person teams that create great games, are they a part of your doomsday scenario? Why are you not tying all of this into the prevalent and growing reality that Game Development has become TOO expensive? Several  MILLION dollars to create an experience that has MAYBE upwards to several days worth of content? And if you follow the recent trends those SEVERAL MILLION dollars game are  not even being received well (go rewatch your video about Starfield for reference of just ONE minor example of MANY). That money could have been spent on SO many other things. It's disgustingly wasteful. I DO see worth and value in AAA dying and all of those artists which would probably have been let go anyway finding a place in tight knit game dev communities to work on actually good products. AAA produces slop, the most economically viable product, and nothing more. It is good that AI will enable smaller teams to create better products.\n\n\"Computers and movies killed the book industry.\" <- Do you see the stupidity of such a statement? Because this is essentially the old guard rhetoric being espoused in this and many other videos regarding AI Tools. AI Tools are here and growing in capability whether we like it or not, Pandora's Box has been opened. As with any change in Technology, Society will adapt accordingly despite it's growing pains (these types of videos).

The best way to do this right is to take the game assets and use them as part of the dataset/weights, then you define the style workflow so things like photorealist/pixar/vray/etc which can then be called as a prompt, from there you run the game engine at the lowest possible settings leaving only the basic info to be drawn on, you can also run the game at say 480 or 720p then use reconstruction and DLSS to output to any arbitrary resolution.  The biggest limitation I have run into doing such things is VRAM and it doesn't look like we will be seeing massive VRAM jumps any time soon.

Obviously many of them just enjoy it very much. So they do it often. \nWhy do we call it addictive? Because knuckleheads out there are brainwashed into thinking, that it does not count as a \"real\" activity and only wage labour does. Which is of course complete BS. \n\nHow about John Carmack? He coded games all day for a loooong time. The more he coded the more he was admired for this activity. Yes it is more complicated, than gaming normally. But it is also just an activity. Nobody EVER claimed he was addicted to coding and that coding was somehow \"not a job\" or whatever. There are people who like to do math and physics as much as others do like gaming. They make their money like that. Nobody calls them \"addicted\". ON THE CONTRARY. They are being looked up to. And let us be honest. \"Workaholic\" is not a term people use to describe addiction, it has become a term which is being admired by others because it means that a person works so many hours. \n\nBut when it comes to gaming it is \"addictive\". BS. People use this term, because it keeps people from doing other things. Like doing their jobs. Things which bring them money. And they call things people PREFER to do so much, that they can keep them from working as \"addictive\". No. This is a wrong mindset. Because if somebody is gaming professionally or as a streamer it suddenly becomes not \"addictive\" but \"admirable\". We need to go away from this ideology. \n\nThere are other hobbies people do a lot, like reading, but no one ever calls them addicted to reading for example. The whole thing is a completely wrong ideology. Gaming is just an activity. It is not addictive. It is popular. People like it a lot. So maybe just do it? How about actually doing what you want? Ever tried? Maybe one should! We just can\u00b4t today, since we have to \"survive\" and make money and we bash activities we ENJOY MUCH MORE as \"addictive\". This is why UBI will bring IMPROVEMENT and SELF FULFILMENT for people instead of just making them things which are being regarded as \"useless\". They are not. They are fine. Gaming is just fine.",

This massive Achilles' Heel is a fact, and a scary one, as it's the only reason why you aren't jobless right now.\n\nML is always going to be limited to its next step, as it has no intuition, true context sensitivity, or true creativity, and it never will. That's not a \"Go humans!\" statement, it's simply the reason we aren't obsolete. Every task, hobby, field of study, profession, et al becomes exponentially more complicated as time goes on, not easier. You can spend your entire life researching Genetics and never be a master of that field, because for every discovery made, you open the door to an entire new frontier of understanding. Any major paradigm shift will break or cripple a ML program. It cannot cope with this, not because it's doing anything incorrect, but because it can't do what we do.",

These short videos take literally hundreds of hours to make, if you want to help allow us to make them faster, please consider becoming a channel member! By becoming a member, your name can be in future videos, you can see behind-the-scenes things that don\u2019t fit in the regular videos, you can also use stickers of Albert, Kai and some other characters our team made in comments  (more coming) :D\n\n\nNOTES\nWhen I mention it took x days to train, that\u2019s in game time, and much larger than the displays indicate since there are 200 copies training simultaneously.\n\nThis is a very long comment going over more of the details of how Albert and Kai works, issues they\u2019ve had, unexpected results etc.\n\n\nTHE BASICS: \nAlbert and Kai were trained using reinforcement learning, meaning they were rewarded for doing things correctly and punished for doing them incorrectly (the reward is just increasing their score, and the punishment is decreasing it). After they finish each attempt, the actions they took are analyzed and the weights in their neural networks (brains) are adjusted using an algorithm called MA-POCA to try to prioritize the actions that led to the most reward. The agents start off making essentially random decisions until Kai accidentally tags Albert in the first room and is rewarded, then, as mentioned above, the weights in his neural network brain are adjusted in order to try to replicate that reward (it wasn\u2019t this simple for this video since we use self-play to train both agents at the same time, more on that later). This leads to Kai learning that tagging Albert is good, and since Albert is punished when he\u2019s tagged, it also leads to Albert learning that getting tagged by Kai isn\u2019t good. This process continues through 10s of millions of steps until one of the agents consistently loses, or the agents are able to counter each other well enough to where it\u2019s a draw.\n\n\nREWARD FUNCTION: \nAlbert and Kai are given two types of rewards, group rewards and individual rewards. When Albert gets tagged he\u2019s punished by getting a -1 group reward and Kai is rewarded by getting a +1 group reward and vice versa, encouraging Kai to tag Albert, and Albert to avoid being tagged by Kai. Additionally, Albert is given an individual reward of 0.001 for each frame he\u2019s alive (0.6 total in a room lasting 10s), and Kai -0.001, to encourage Kai to try to tag Albert as quickly as possible. When we introduce the grabbable cubes we also give Albert an individual reward of +1 the first time he picks up the cube to make sure Albert actually starts using the cube (since without this, the rewards were too infrequent for Albert to learn to use it effectively).\n\n\nBRAIN: \nAlbert and Kai\u2019s brains are neural networks with 4 layers each (one input layer, 2 hidden layers and one output layer).\n\nThe agents collect information about the scene through direct values and raycasts. Every 5 frames they\u2019re fed data about their position in the room, the opponent\u2019s position, velocity, direction etc., and they also collect information through raycasts (a simplified version of eyes). The agent's eyes (raycasts) can differentiate between walls, ground, moveableObjects and Kai/Albert.\n\nThe agents' brains (neural networks) are given the data the agents collect from direct values and raycasts and use them to predict 4 numbers for the respective agent which control how that agent moves. An example of an output of one of the neural networks is: [1, 2, 0, 1], this would be interpreted as [1=move forward, 2=turn right, 0=don\u2019t jump, 1=try to grab], so the agent being controlled by this neural network would try to move forward while turning right and grabbing.\n\nThe fact that we have two agents training simultaneously complicates things a bit, normally we\u2019re able just update the agents brains every x steps, but if we did that for both brains at the same time then they would struggle developing multiple strategies, since reinforcement learning tends to be best at finding a single solution, that would lead to the winner dominating and the loser stuck doing the same strategy over and over. The way we tackle this issue is by using something called self-play. Since we use self-play, we technically only train one agent at a time, and swap which is being trained every 100k steps. When we\u2019re training Albert, we use a recent model of Kai\u2019s brain as his opponent, and to avoid there only being one strategy, we store 10 recent brains to use as opponents, swapping them out every couple thousand steps so that Albert learns to beat all of them and not just one. This results in a much more general AI that\u2019s hard to exploit.\n\n\nUNEXPECTED BEHAVIORS:\nIn room 1 Albert manages to break out of the room by exploiting a small hole in the hitbox near the top of the room, which was there because I didn\u2019t make the hitboxes on the walls tall enough. Though Albert used it to escape, I\u2019m not convinced he actually would learn to do it consistently. The challenge with this video is that it can be difficult to interpret the agent\u2019s behaviors; Albert could be making certain unexpected moves as a way to exploit Kai\u2019s poorly trained brain to get him to make bad moves, or Albert could just be making these unexpected moves because he hasn't trained enough. Albert was able to find the hole a few times, however he wasn\u2019t able to do it consistently, this could be from either him not training long enough, his observations not making it easy to detect when he can jump out, or Kai quickly learning to counter him getting to the display in time.\n\nIn room 2 Albert also manages to glitch out of the room, and he was able to do this consistently. We made sure the cube grabbing functionality was coded as rigorously as possible, even with it automatically detaching the grab if the force exerted is too high, I couldn\u2019t find a single way of exploiting it in testing, but Albert certainly didn\u2019t have issues finding it.\n\nAlbert also had a couple moments of throwing the cubes at Kai and spinning with the cube to throw Kai out of the room, we didn\u2019t even consider this being a possibility before training, AI\u2019s able to come up with some really clever solutions to problems.\n\n\nOTHER\nThank you so much to our amazing team that helped make this video! Jonas helped with setting up the character controls, Tyler helped create the clean grabbing functionality, Catt helped edit and Andrew and Steve helped solve any issues we ran into while making the video.

Perhaps yet another tower that just deals splash damage like a mortar, choice of upgrades for increased damage or increased range (possibly at the cost of fire rate).  And when upgrading the current default towers, perhaps add another upgrade type to choose from instead of just 2x damage and range.\n\nI think it would be interesting to see the strategies that evolve from this.\n\nIdea 2)  Have it be a vs match.

This idea will completely change the gaming experience and make it more realistic and lively. Incorporating artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) technologies into gaming characters will enable them to understand commands and interact with players naturally. The characters will be able to talk to the players, understand their words, and respond to them based on the different context and situations. For example, in a game like GTA 5, characters on the street will be able to interact with you, understand you, and respond to you naturally, and this will make the game more interactive and lively. In Red Dead Redemption 2, characters will be able to interact with you based on your actions and mood, and talk to you normally. Developing character interaction in open-world games using artificial intelligence will be a major step towards providing a more realistic and enjoyable gaming experience, and this will open new doors for creativity in game design and provide unique experiences for players.",

The word \"gaming\" is a non-specific word usually associated with gambling and casinos. It's one thing to use the word \"gaming\" in a Scrabble magazine, a poker website, or a snooker video, since fans of those games understand that \"gaming\" is about the hobby in question. But If you're going to talk about a type of game or sport in mainstream media, you need to specify what type of gaming it is.\n\nI also find this 'activity-based' language odd. Videogames are creative works, not a physical activity like hiking or swimming. I'm a fan of \"books, videogames and movies\", NOT \"booking, gaming and movie-ing\".

I still game casually, once in a while not often, and I do enjoy it. It's gotten me through tough times and maximized the best times as well. But I must say, I respect companies that release full playable games without predatory tactics like microtransactions, loot boxes or live service models.

I agree that the social interaction makes teens more attached, but that's because those teens may lack other forms of social interaction, not necessarily addiction from the start. It's the same with social media. And it's not all bad either, but there are many risks with minors being online in general.\n\nBut, I don't think the video games, social media or the Internet are as problematic. The core problem has always been a lack of cultural immersion and education stemming from families. Also, some people have a more addictive nature compared to others, so its difficult to assess with generalizations.\n\nAlso, there will always be kids that dream about other things instead of their school work, but many times different forms of media influence even their career plans, so I think that point is completely off and is almost unrelated",

No warning, Adrian just banned me after the bed wetter told Adrian to make me stop, booo hoooo hoooo. Adrian banned me, no warning, nothing so I no longer respect Adrian or his Diaper Clan anymore, life is to short for that nonsense Majchy. Enjoy watching your games but remember it's just a game. You will always come across mean people where ever you go Majchy. \nI just dont waste time \"anymore\" with people like that. Remember to record and screen capture \"everything\" hateful  that is posted. \nI wish you the best Majchy and don't let others bring you down, it's only the internet after all, just report them.

God LOVES You so much that He sent His Only Begotten Son Jesus who lived a sinless life that we couldn\u2019t live, became sin for us, and Died in our place at the Cross for the penalty of all our sins. We are all born into sin because of the rebellion of our original parents Adam and Eve in the garden after they were tempted and deceived by the devil. That same devil is alive today convincing people that God isn\u2019t real so you\u2019ll get dragged into Hell for eternity with him. Your next breath isn\u2019t guaranteed, and if you die in your sins without being saved you\u2019ll spend Eternity in Hell. Give your life to Christ Right Now while you still can. We are living in the Last Days the Bible told us about, Jesus is Coming back SOON!!!!!. God Bless\u2764\u2764",

For example, Neo Berlin I can imagine it being as awful as Cyberpunk 2077's release, if not worse, I doubt it'll be fixed if it even does come out like Cyberpunk 2077 was, started off bad but was fixed/polished and became incredible, don't see that often.",

HL1 was awesome 'For its time' HL2 had Graphics and Physics kinda/sorta but had a '1982' vibe which was cool n all but was ultimately too short and not as enjoyable as HL1 was back in the day ! They had lost ground even then to other kids on the block. 25 years later... Who Cares. I'm getting old, my priorities have changed and I still haven't forgiven them for the Ep1,Ep2 ..... EP3 ?

You knew the game was going to be decent unless it outright wasn't you thing. But there's so much shovelware now like pretty much this entire list. Borderlands 4 has some hype, but unless the game can somehow grasp the Borderlands 2 feel, it's just going to be another so-so entry. The first Random game is pretty good especially if you like Tim Burton movies, so maybe the second will be good too.",

That little detail with that specific knife (the style of handle/blade was later described as a Siciliano) is very impressive.  They must have consulted someone to get that detail right.

The game AI is done in a manner where as long as you do not seem like a threat, you are ignored.

While I would have enjoyed a good sequel of lost in random, I don't like how they changed the way it looks and plays.\n\nThat's really all I am excited for at the moment. None of these games in this video or at this gamescom caused any excitement for me.

That's why only truly talented and skilled people took on making games. Today anyone can download a powerful tool and make a game that looks great. But isn't great in any other way. There are very, very few exceptions to this rule today, that's why there are very, very few good games being released, and I can't remember the last truly great game after let's say RDR2, which was 6 years ago, and Witcher 3 and DLC's before that, which was more than 8 years ago.

You command squads/platoons/companies/battalions of troops in battle; directing them to locations and points of interest on the battlefield. You can also take command of member of the unit(possibly the unit commander or  some leader of sorts) and fight to help out that unit and once that fight is under control you can transition to the overview and go down to another unit to assist them - all while keeping an eye the overall battle. This type of game can be adapted to any era\u2026.from medieval battles, the Roman Empire, ancient Middle East, Japanese and Chinese  empires, to modern battles like WWI and WW2, The American Civil/revolutionary war, to games like lord of the rings and etc. Battles can be based off of history or completely made up scenarios.

Hell is us looks really interesting but im still not quite sure what its about. For some reason it gives me Death Stranding vibes idk why. Not sure what Astropulse is about either. At this point I'm convinced that Plan 8 is vapourware, we havent heard anything about it in awhile. Pioner looks interesting, kind of gives me Fallout vibes. I guess we probably should have seen it coming that they would make a John Wick game with as successful as the movies have been.  Killer Bean..... I have no words. Ashfall, Fallout much? Crisol Theater of Idolls looks interesting. Is that blood- fueled guns  in the trailer? Phantom Line looks fun. I'm REALLY excited for ArcheAge Chronicles. I suppose the Hitman company would be the best company to handle a James Bond game",

I just wish games could live up to their first reveals and actually tell the truth about how it will actually play.

To my very first console the COLECOVISION. Then the NES, to SEGA GENESIS. PS1, PS2, to my very first PC in 2001 and my first online gaming experience with RTCW for 2 straight years. I took a few years off after that. Then I tried GTA SA on an old PS2 a buddy happen to have and realized how fantastic games had increasingly become. Not that I didn't have a clue, but that game really hooked me again. \nSo I finally afforded a PS3 and my first 47 inch Samsung because GTA 4 was out for awhile and I had to try it, and I knew GTA 5 was coming and IT LOOKED INSANE! I was there when it came out on day one! It was a total blast and addiction. Once the single player story was done in the first few days and I plunged into ONLINE, it was mental. Day after day of grinding, exploring, chatting, making Crews, designing my own Crew patch...etc. 2 years had gone by again and it was enough. The only thing I really played after that was hockey with my brother. \nGot a PS4 to try GTA 5 on it for awhile and that was fun for awhile. But by then I had already amassed many things in the game because of the money glitches in the PS3 version at the beginning. Since I stopped playing I'm amazed at how much more they had added onto the game though! By the time they FINALLY released HEISTS I was already out of it.\nI've played a couple of games since then on PS like The DIVISION, and GR WILDLANDS. CoD WW2 ..etc. But nothing too serious. I don't play online with strangers at all. And the few friends that also play online are into other games usually.\n\nAnyways, long winded point is, seeing videos like these makes an old time game lover like me really want to get into it again. Especially when you see a trailer like GTA6's. But it's all so convoluted now. SO MANY microtransactions, and social media side stuff..etc. And worst of all, the COSTS. My GOD. I don't even have a PS5 yet, or a 4K TV to be able to take advantage of it. And I can completly FORGET about playing anything on PC! That is a whole other price jump! When I see the setups that some of these TWITCH and YOUTUBE gamers have it boggles the mind how much some of them must be worth! We're probably talking 10K for some of them!\nOK. That's my 1AM \"I'm bored\" rant.\nThanks for reading, and don't be too harsh on an old guy like me.\n\ud83d\ude00",

Surely one or a few phd level mathematicians and someone or somefew like an engineer at phd level too could perfect every game making engine in only one year and someone in design, another thing of cretins and idiots in apps other than computer games that a small room full of children could spot every problem of almost every available app on every platform and it's cretinous interface within a matter of days of using it should have been obvious only a year after the first personal computer app was released, and they charge money, sometimes monthly for these idiot apps and devices which almost seem if they are designed for us to burn down civilisation and go back to being hunters and gatherers which actually might not be a bad idea considering what human overpopulation is doing to the millions of species of every forest and coastline and natural environment around the world, especially our forests, jungles, rainforests, reefs and other special regions for the diversity of life microscopic, insect, plant, mammal, bird, fish, shellfish, fungi, rodent, marsupial, bug, arachnoid, etc. etc,.

Just let the games speak for themselves, i feel like it's a bit unfair that you always bring up such a negative point when you show a pixel art game. If people want to complain in the comments, let them. But keep the negativity there, is my opinion.\n\nLike in this video, you mentioned it multiple times like you're making excuses as to why you let it be on the list. You even assured that there would be some more non-pixel art games when displaying one, that's a little bit extreme? I'd say we've gotten it by now. And you're even selling pixel art merch too. I think it's time to start speaking about pixel art in a positive manner, don't you agree, Zakh?\n\nEDIT: I mean i get it, don't get me wrong. You want to make sure everyone enjoys your videos. But i think you're enabling the negativity by doing this every single time. I didn't use to mind pixel art at all, but now my brain associates it with something controversial because of you as you have to apologize for just showing it.

A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead and Space Marine 2. Since Space Marine 2 is their upcoming crown jewel, I highly doubt they would want their player base divided between 2 multiplayer games and a single player game.\n\n2: Lack of marketing. Second half of the year, and we haven\u2019t heard a single thing about the game. No beta, no new info or a simple release date? That doesn\u2019t seem right in my book for a game that\u2019s coming out this year.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to be wrong about this and am ready to eat crow if they show and announce some stuff during GamesCon.

I think atm I'm most curious about Where Winds Meet, from the sound of it - open world action RPG set in a Song dynasty period - seems like an ideal game for me. New Life is Strange, Avowed and Clockwork Revolutions are also smth I wanna try sooner or later, South of Midnight too. Problem is there's also a lot of already released games I still haven't played and really want to (Hellblade II and PC release of GoW: Ragnarok mostly atm). And I still haven't finished Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, DLC for Talos Principle II and Dustborn.",

Inzoi/Paralives/Light no Fire/DokeV are indeed ambitious, because they do things we haven't seen before in a game. But let's say Loftia out of the 6 stardew valley copies: what does it bring that we haven't seen before in ANY games so far?

It is revealed that the head of that mysterious circle is the female relative and that the youngster has powers, too. \nI think you can grow potatoes, too, you need to help out with the house and garden at first, rip out weeds and water the potato plants. \n\nIf you have any clue, please let me know, Google didn't help me at all! \ud83d\ude05 \nThank you if you read this. \u2764",
